# UNINOTE

UNINOTE is a mobile and desktop application which aims to help university students to have a good organization of courses and information related to them (such as info about the exam modes, homework, ..). Since professors do not all use the same platform (some use Piazza, others Classroom and others e-learning), students often do not remember if a professor uses one platform rather than another.  UNINOTE provides a clear university organization.
